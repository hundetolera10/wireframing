ðŸ§© Introduction to Wireframing
What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint or skeletal framework for a website or application. It represents the basic structure and layout of a digital product, focusing on content placement, navigation, and user flow rather than visual design or color schemes.

Wireframes are typically created in the early stages of design to communicate ideas and plan how users will interact with the interface.

Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design and development process because it:

Clarifies structure: Helps designers and developers visualize the layout and hierarchy of content.

Improves communication: Provides a shared understanding among team members, stakeholders, and clients.

Saves time and cost: Detects usability and layout issues early before development begins.

Focuses on user experience: Ensures that navigation and functionality align with user needs.

Conclusion

Wireframing serves as the foundation of the design process, allowing teams to experiment, collaborate, and refine ideas before investing time in high-fidelity design or coding.
